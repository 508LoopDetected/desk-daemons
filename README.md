# Desk Daemons

A self-imposed challenge to use SvelteKit and Three.js to build a 3D turn-based RPG battle system. There's no real end-goal in sight, just something to occasionally revisit when practicing new concepts or whatever.

### Done:
- Battle logic & skill formulas: damage, crit, ailment, healing, etc.
- Megaten-like skill set & resistances
- Nocturne-inspired "Press Turn" system
- Demo character models & basic animations, extra janky for yuks

Currently, a full battle can be played out with a single enemy (hint: weak to Zan). There's maybe a little cursor-based maze game somewhere in here too.

### To Do:
- Reorganize Battle component into separate files
