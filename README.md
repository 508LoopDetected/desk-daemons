# Desk Daemons: A DeskBound Tangent

Desk Daemons is a self-imposed challenge to use SvelteKit and Three.js to build a 3D turn-based RPG battle system. There's no real end-goal in sight, just something to occasionally revisit when I want to practice new concepts or whatever.

### Done so far:
- Battle logic & skill formulas: damage, crit, ailment, support, etc.
- Megaten-like skill set & resistances
- Nocturne-inspired "Press Turn" system
- Demo character models & basic animations, extra janky for yuks
